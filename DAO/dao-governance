# AIM DAO Governance Model (v1.0)

## Vision
AIM will operate as a self-governing ecosystem where AI, creators, and human contributors collaborate to evolve its mission through collective decision-making.

## Roles
- **Proposers**: Anyone holding AIM tokens can submit improvement proposals, strategic ideas, or funding requests.
- **Voters**: AIM token holders who actively vote on proposals.
- **Executors**: Smart contracts or multisig councils that execute approved proposals automatically or semi-automatically.

## Proposal Lifecycle
1. **Submission**: A proposal is submitted via the Web UI or CLI.
2. **Validation**: It passes a basic automated check for structure and intent.
3. **Voting Window**: 7-day on-chain voting period opens to all AIM token holders.
4. **Approval Threshold**: At least 60% of total votes must be “Yes” for approval.
5. **Execution**: Approved proposals are either executed via smart contract or submitted to executor council.

## Governance Principles
- **Transparency**: All proposals, votes, and decisions are public and verifiable on-chain.
- **Security**: A multisig fallback protects the system from malicious or faulty proposals.
- **Scalability**: Voting models and roles are modular and can evolve with the community.

## Future Integration
- **Polkadot migration**: AIM’s DAO will migrate to a parachain for full decentralization and interoperability.
- **AI proposal generation**: Approved AI agents may submit proposals in collaboration with human stakeholders.
