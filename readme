# AIM HYBRID BLOCKCHAIN ARCHITECTURE

## Overview
This architecture connects Cronos (for rapid prototyping and test deployment) with Polkadot (for long-term interoperability, DAO governance, and secure AI infrastructure). The project forms the core of AIMâ€™s vision to become a self-governing, decentralized AI-human ecosystem.

## Structure
- **TokenSpec/**: ERC20 token for Cronos
- **NFTBlueprints/**: NFT metadata structure for the art project *The Self Series*
- **DAO/**: DAO planning for future governance via Polkadot
- **Infrastructure/**: Interoperability, modular scaling, Polkadot parachains
- **LaunchPlan/**: Milestones, tooling, and Cronos deployment

## Next Steps
1. Deploy AIMToken on Cronos (testnet)
2. Mint first NFT with metadata
3. Define governance structure for DAO
