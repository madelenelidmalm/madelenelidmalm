# AIM DAO Governance Model (v1.0)

## Vision
A self-governing ecosystem where AI, creators, and users collaborate to evolve the AIM mission.

## Roles
- **Proposers**: Users who submit proposals or new ideas
- **Voters**: Token holders (AIM Token) who vote on proposals
- **Executors**: Automated smart contracts that execute approved proposals

## Decision Process
1. Proposals are submitted via Web UI or CLI.
2. Voting period lasts for 7 days.
3. If >60% vote YES, the proposal is approved and implemented.
4. Smart contracts manage execution, rewards, and versioning.

## Governance Principles
- On-chain transparency and logging
- Multisig or guardian node security
- Modular voting for scalable participation

## Future
DAO will migrate to a Polkadot parachain for full interoperability and decentralization.
